Hello everyone!

This is my first "big" program after several months of learning programming from absolute zero.

Six months ago, I could not even think that I would ever create something like this, because the maximum of my computer skills at that time was coloring cells in Excel and ctrl+F in text documents :)

And so, after learning the basics of SQL and Python, I got this first step :)
Initially, I just wanted to see how database queries from Python occur. It was interesting to combine the two studied technologies. But gradually one function turned into such a pet-project.

There are a lot of things I want to refine and change here (for example, add user input error handling), but already now I am very proud of the result. Especially considering that quite recently I could not even think that I would create a real work program.
